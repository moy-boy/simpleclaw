# `openclaw channels`

Manage chat channel accounts and their runtime status on the Gateway.

- Gateway configuration: [Configuration](/gateway/configuration)

## Common commands

```bash
openclaw channels list
openclaw channels list --all
openclaw channels status
openclaw channels capabilities
openclaw channels capabilities --channel discord --target channel:123
openclaw channels capabilities --channel discord --target channel:<voice-channel-id>
openclaw channels resolve --channel discord "#general" "@jane"
openclaw channels logs --channel all
```

`channels list` shows chat channels only: configured accounts by default, with `installed`, `configured`, and `enabled` status tags per account. Pass `--all` to also surface bundled channels that have no configured account yet and installable catalog channels that are not yet on disk. OpenAI subscription auth and model usage snapshots are no longer printed here; use `openclaw models auth list`, `openclaw status`, or `openclaw models list`.

## Status / capabilities / resolve / logs

- `channels status`: `--channel <name>`, `--probe`, `--timeout <ms>`, `--json`
- `channels capabilities`: `--channel <name>`, `--account <id>` (only with `--channel`), `--target <dest>`, `--timeout <ms>`, `--json`
- `channels resolve`: `<entries...>`, `--channel <name>`, `--account <id>`, `--kind <auto|user|group>`, `--json`
- `channels logs`: `--channel <name|all>`, `--lines <n>`, `--json`

`channels status --probe` is the live path: on a reachable gateway it runs per-account
`probeAccount` and optional `auditAccount` checks, so output can include transport
state plus probe results such as `works`, `probe failed`, `audit ok`, or `audit failed`.
If the gateway is unreachable, `channels status` falls back to config-only summaries
instead of live probe output.

Do not use `openclaw sessions`, Gateway `sessions.list`, or the agent
`sessions_list` tool as a channel socket-health signal. Those surfaces report
stored conversation rows, not provider runtime state. After a Discord provider
restart, a connected but quiet account may be healthy while no Discord session
row appears until the next inbound or outbound conversation event.

## Add / remove accounts

```bash
openclaw channels add --channel telegram --token <bot-token>
openclaw channels add --channel discord --token <bot-token>
openclaw channels remove --channel telegram --delete
```

<Tip>
`openclaw channels add --help` shows the available Telegram and Discord setup flags.
</Tip>

`channels remove` only operates on installed/configured channel plugins. Use `channels add` first for installable catalog channels.
For runtime-backed channel plugins, `channels remove` also asks the running Gateway to stop the selected account before it updates config, so disabling or deleting an account does not leave the old listener active until restart.

Common non-interactive add surfaces include:

- bot-token channels: `--token`, `--bot-token`, `--app-token`, `--token-file`
- `--use-env` for default-account env-backed auth where supported

This simplified setup supports Telegram and Discord channel setup. If the generated plugin allowlist is active, direct `channels add --channel <name>` rejects unsupported channels before installing or configuring them.

When you run `openclaw channels add` without flags, the interactive wizard can prompt:

- account ids per selected channel
- optional display names for those accounts
- `Route these channel accounts to agents now?`

If you confirm bind now, the wizard asks which agent should own each configured channel account and writes account-scoped routing bindings.

You can also manage the same routing rules later with `openclaw agents bindings`, `openclaw agents bind`, and `openclaw agents unbind` (see [agents](/cli/agents)).

When you add a non-default account to a channel that is still using single-account top-level settings, OpenClaw promotes account-scoped top-level values into the channel's account map before writing the new account. Supported channels land those values in `channels.<channel>.accounts.default`.

Routing behavior stays consistent:

- Existing channel-only bindings (no `accountId`) continue to match the default account.
- `channels add` does not auto-create or rewrite bindings in non-interactive mode.
- Interactive setup can optionally add account-scoped bindings.

If your config was already in a mixed state (named accounts present and top-level single-account values still set), run `openclaw doctor --fix` to move account-scoped values into `accounts.default`.

## Login and logout (interactive)

Telegram and Discord bot-token accounts are configured with `channels add`; they do not normally require a separate QR or browser login step.

If a supported channel exposes an interactive login flow, run `channels login` from a terminal on the gateway host. Agent `exec` blocks interactive login flows; use channel-native login tools from chat when available.

## Troubleshooting

- Run `openclaw status --deep` for a broad probe.
- Use `openclaw doctor` for guided fixes.
- `openclaw channels list` no longer prints model provider usage/quota snapshots. For those, use `openclaw status` (overview) or `openclaw models list` (per-provider).
- `openclaw channels status` falls back to config-only summaries when the gateway is unreachable. If a supported channel credential is configured via SecretRef but unavailable in the current command path, it reports that account as configured with degraded notes instead of showing it as not configured.

## Capabilities probe

Fetch provider capability hints (intents/scopes where available) plus static feature support:

```bash
openclaw channels capabilities
openclaw channels capabilities --channel discord --target channel:123
```

Notes:

- `--channel` is optional; omit it to list configured Telegram and Discord accounts.
- `--account` is only valid with `--channel`.
- `--target` accepts `channel:<id>` or a raw numeric channel id and only applies to Discord. For Discord voice channels, the permission check flags missing `ViewChannel`, `Connect`, `Speak`, `SendMessages`, and `ReadMessageHistory`.
- Probes are provider-specific: Discord intents + optional channel permissions; Telegram bot flags + webhook. Channels without probes report `Probe: unavailable`.

## Resolve names to IDs

Resolve channel/user names to IDs using the provider directory:

```bash
openclaw channels resolve --channel discord "My Server/#support" "@someone"
```

Notes:

- Use `--kind user|group|auto` to force the target type.
- Resolution prefers active matches when multiple entries share the same name.
- `channels resolve` is read-only. If a selected account is configured via SecretRef but that credential is unavailable in the current command path, the command returns degraded unresolved results with notes instead of aborting the entire run.
- `channels resolve` does not install channel plugins. Use `channels add --channel telegram` or `channels add --channel discord` before resolving names.
